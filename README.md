# Pacman AI – Artificial Intelligence Project in Python

This project consists of implementing intelligent agents to solve various challenges within the classic Pacman game using search algorithms. It was developed as part of a university-level Artificial Intelligence course.

## Overview

Pacman must navigate mazes, collect food, and visit corners using different AI search strategies. All solutions were implemented from scratch by our team.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search with custom heuristics
- Consistent, non-trivial heuristics to improve performance
- Solved challenges such as:
  - Collecting all food
  - Visiting all four corners
  - Finding optimal and suboptimal paths

## How to Run

To run a test agent:

```bash
